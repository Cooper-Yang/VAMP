-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#1 Inside this folder "BLUEPRINTS", there is the same blueprint example for each different UE version.

#2 Drag and Drop this file "BP_SerialCom_UExx.uasset" into your project.s

#3 Drag and Drop ""BP_Serial_UEXxx" blueprint inside your Level.

#4 Inside the BP_Serial_UExx, change the "Port" number to your correspondent port in your micro-controller or Serial Communication Application.

#5 Connect your Arduino or any other Serial Communication device you your computer.

#6 If you see "PORT IS INITIALIZED!" on your screen, that is a confirmation that the port is connected to a Serial Port.


#7 Once you confirm your Com port, you are ready to test the blueprint.
	- Press the "SPACE BAR" to print a string on the serial port and send another message to the UE screen.
	- Press the letter "Q" to close the Serial Port.
	- Press the letter "Z" to reconnect to the Serial Port.	

Enjoy it!
